# Konnect Dev Portal Client

This repo is the [OSS][oss-url] Konnect Dev Portal Client, you may use this as a starting point for you own custom Konnect Dev Portal that consumes the Konnect Portal API.
## Getting started

### Prerequisites:

* Kong Konnect account
   * You can Start a Free trial at: [konghq.com][kong-konnect-register-url]
   * Documentation for Kong Konnect is available at: [docs.konghq.com][konnect-docs-url]
* Yarn [^1.22.x][yarn-install url]

Install dependencies

```sh
yarn 
```

Create local .env file

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `VITE_PORTAL_API_URL` value in your current environment i.e .env file or local environment, this should match either the Kong supplied portal URL ending in `portal.konghq.com` or the [custom Portal URL set in Konnect][custom-dev-portal-url]. Be sure to set the Custom Client domain to match the domain you will be serving the portal out of to avoid CORS issues.

For Development you can provide any portal API URL, it is proxied by Vite, so you do not need to set the custom client domain.

Run vite dev with

```sh
yarn dev #optional --verbose
```

Run tests with
```sh
yarn test:e2e
```

## Building for production release

Build production bundle '_(dist/)_' for deployment with
